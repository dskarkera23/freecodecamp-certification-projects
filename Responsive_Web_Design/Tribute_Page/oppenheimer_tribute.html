       <h4>Life history</h4>
       <p id="history">J. Robert Oppenheimer (1904-1967) was an American theoretical physicist known for his pivotal role in the Manhattan Project during World War II, which led to the development of the first atomic bomb. His leadership and scientific brilliance contributed significantly to the success of the project. Despite his achievements, he faced scrutiny during the McCarthy era due to his past associations with left-leaning individuals and organizations, which led to the revocation of his security clearance. Throughout his life, Oppenheimer remained a complex and controversial figure in the fields of science and politics.</p>
